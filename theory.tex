\title{Aster Models}

\chapter{Preface}

This is a book about the theory of aster models.  Its main intended
readers are implementers of aster software.  So far, that is just the
author.  The reason for the book is to go into all the gory details
so the software can do the Right Thing.

Other readers may also find this book useful in having all of the theory
of aster models in one place and presented with consistent notation.
But they may have to skip a lot of material they don't want to read.
